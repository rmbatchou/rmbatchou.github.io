## About Me

Hi, I'm **Sonya Rolande Odeniyi**! I am currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s in Data Science** at DePaul University, Class of 2025 ðŸŽ“. As a professional **Actuary**, I am passionate about uncovering insights through data and using predictive analytics to solve complex problems. ðŸ“Š Feel free to reach out to me at [rolandembatchou@yahoo.com](mailto:rolandembatchou@yahoo.com).


## About My Advisor

Professor Ilyas Ustun is a distinguished faculty member at DePaul University's School of Computing. His research spans the cutting-edge fields of **Data Analysis**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Big Sensed Data**. ðŸš€ For more information, visit his [Faculty Page](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Faculty-and-Staff/Pages/faculty-info.aspx?fid=1462).

## About My Research Experience

### **Project Focus**  
- Investigate the impact of removing the race coefficient from the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) calculation, specifically focusing on African American/Black race, to improve health equity in kidney transplantation outcomes.

### **Key Objectives**  
- Assess the potential change in kidney transplant outcomes by recalculating KDPI scores without the race coefficient.
- Analyze the effects on patient survival rates, kidney availability, and graft survival after the proposed policy change.
- Explore the implications for health equity, aiming to reduce disparities in kidney transplantation by ensuring a fair evaluation of kidneys from Black donors.

### **Data and Methodology**  
- Use historical data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) between 2000-2019.
- Employ machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost) and statistical methods (e.g., Cox Proportional Hazards, Difference-in-Differences) for predictive analysis.
- Implement data cleaning, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize model performance.

### **Significance**  
- The research aims to inform policy changes that could enhance fairness in kidney allocation and ultimately improve patient outcomes by addressing systemic biases in current evaluation practices.

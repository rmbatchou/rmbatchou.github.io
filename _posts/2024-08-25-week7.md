title: "Week 7: Analyzing Datasets in Silos - Tackling ImmunoFollowup and PRA Crossmatch Data"
---

This Blog Week, I focused on analyzing individual datasets within the larger UNOS collection, such as ImmunoFollowup, PRA Crossmatch, and KidneyMaligFollowup. Each of these datasets provides crucial information but comes with its own challenges. For instance, the PRA Crossmatch data has a lot of missing entries, requiring significant imputation. Analyzing these silos separately helped me build a more comprehensive understanding of the transplant process and the factors that may impact outcomes. The next step will be to merge these insights and align them with my research goals.

Highlights:
- Completed EDA for ImmunoFollowup, focusing on treatment adherence and patient health status.
- Addressed challenges with missing data in PRA Crossmatch, using imputation and encoding techniques.
- Gained a deeper understanding of specific post-transplant variables that will be crucial in future analyses.

title: "Struggling with EDA on a Large Dataset"
---

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) began this Blog Week, and itâ€™s been a mixed experience. On one hand, visualizing trends and patterns in the dataset was exciting. On the other hand, the size of the data continues to be a hurdle, as I had to split the data into manageable chunks to avoid crashes. I focused on understanding variable distributions, outliers, and correlations between key features like donor age and transplant success. This phase emphasized the importance of data preprocessing before jumping into model building.

Highlights:
- Conducted initial visualizations, revealing potential disparities in kidney allocations across different demographics.
- Applied outlier detection techniques using z-scores and IQR, improving data quality.
- Frustrated by slow processing times and repeated code adjustments to handle memory limitations.

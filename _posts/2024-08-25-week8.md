title: "Week 7: Merging Datasets and Defining the Final Analysis Target"
---

After Blog Weeks of analyzing datasets separately, I started merging the insights to create a unified dataset that will guide my final analysis. The merging process required careful alignment of variables and handling inconsistencies across datasets. I spent time verifying the integrity of the combined data, ensuring that no crucial information was lost in the process. With the dataset now integrated, Iâ€™m ready to finalize what my model target will be, setting the stage for feature selection and modeling in the upcoming Blog Weeks.

Highlights:
- Successfully merged multiple datasets, retaining key variables for analysis.
- Aligned inconsistent data formats and filled gaps to ensure comprehensive insights.
- Finalized the key factors that will be used to define my predictive model target.

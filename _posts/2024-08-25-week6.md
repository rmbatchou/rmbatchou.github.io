title: "Week 6: Segmenting Data for Deeper Analysis - Breaking it Down by Cohorts"
---

Given the dataset’s complexity, I decided to analyze it in segments based on specific cohorts like age, ethnicity, and medical history. This approach allowed me to dive deeper into understanding specific patterns without overwhelming my system’s memory. I’ve started noticing interesting trends when analyzing smaller groups—like how older donors with certain medical conditions have disproportionately lower KDPI scores. These insights are helping me refine the features I want to focus on as I prepare to define my model target.

Highlights:
- Segmented the dataset into cohorts to explore targeted patterns in kidney allocations.
- Discovered key disparities that align with the findings from my literature review.
- Identified the core variables that will likely influence my model design later.

title: "Finalizing Literature Review - Insights on Bias and Equity in Transplants"
---

In my final Blog Week of literature review, I delved into studies focusing on health equity and the role of sociodemographic factors in transplant outcomes. One striking finding was how older KDPI models included race as a factor, contributing to disparities in kidney allocation. I also looked into methodologies that excluded such biased variables, leading to more equitable outcomes. This review set the stage for my data analysis, as it highlighted the need for careful handling of sensitive variables and the challenges that lie ahead.

Highlights:
- Learned about the disparities caused by including race in KDPI calculations.
- Identified key sociodemographic factors that can be incorporated without introducing bias.
- Prepared to move into the data processing phase, equipped with theoretical knowledge and practical considerations.

title: "Week 2: Exploring Machine Learning Approaches in Transplant Prediction Models"
---

Continuing my literature review, I focused on the machine learning models used in kidney transplant research. Papers discussed advanced techniques like Random Survival Forests, Lasso regression, and permutation importance for feature selection. The reading expanded my perspective on how complex interactions between donor characteristics can be captured more effectively with machine learning compared to traditional models. I found it particularly interesting how models could be tailored based on cohorts like age, providing more accurate predictions.

Highlights:
- Explored ensemble learning techniques and their application in transplant predictions.
- Discovered the limitations of existing statistical models like Cox regression when compared to machine learning approaches.
- Considered how I might implement a hybrid approach in my research later.

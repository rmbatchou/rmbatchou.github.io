title: "Preparing the UNOS Dataset for Analysis"
---

This Blog Week, I finally got my hands on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) dataset and began the process of cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. The dataset is massive, covering nearly two decades and including various variables like donor characteristics, follow-up data, and transplant outcomes. I focused on handling missing data, removing irrelevant columns, and normalizing variables to standardize the dataset. The process was challenging, particularly due to memory constraints, which required me to break down the dataset and work in smaller chunks.

Highlights:
- Removed columns with excessive missing data and standardized continuous variables.
- Implemented imputation techniques like Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) for handling gaps in numerical data.
- Encountered memory issues that required segmenting the dataset to manage processing load.

title: "Week 9: Wrapping Up EDA and Finalizing the Model Target"
---

The exploratory phase is finally wrapping up, and it’s been a journey full of learning, frustration, and progress. I have now defined my model target, which involves evaluating the impact of removing the race coefficient from the KDPI calculation. The focus will be on predicting kidney availability, transplant rates, and patient survival outcomes based on the revised KDPI scores. While the challenges of large datasets and technical limitations slowed me down, I’m now better equipped to move forward with model building in the next phase.

Highlights:
- Finalized the model target focusing on health equity in kidney transplant allocation.
- Integrated all data insights into a coherent framework, ready for feature selection.
- Feeling more confident about moving into the modeling phase, with clearer goals and a solid dataset.
